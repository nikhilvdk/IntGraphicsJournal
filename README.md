### Rain Room

The first piece that stood out to me was Random International's Rain Room at MoMA. The rain room is a 1100 sqft exhibition with water falling from the ceiling. Visitors are able to walk though the rain without getting wet due to 3D tracking cameras which are used to sense a person’s presence. It was the first piece that came to my mind when I thought of users interfacing with art through technology. After braving the seemingly endless lines at the MoMA, where you can see the installation from the outside, the observer becomes the participant. Lighting is kept low to invoke dramatic shadows and a sense of obscurity. The sound the rain makes is an almost deafening white noise. This adds to the idea of being cocooned and protected – both physically from the rain, but also audibly and visually. I find it interesting that people are so excited to be immersed in rain, which we usually are so unhappy to encounter. Often times, visitors even try to reach out and touch it if the sensor misses them. Visitors have the freedom to walk through the space, creating the art and escaping to a reality where humans have control over the rain.

### A Subtlety

Another piece that I found really exciting and immersive was Kara Walker’s A Subtlety in Brooklyn’s famous Domino Sugar factory. I was able to go to this exhibit a few years ago and it was an exciting experience. The exhibit is inside an old and decrepit sugar factory that leaks from the ceilings and still has molasses dripping from the walls (I remember having to sign a waiver before entering). Domino allowed the art to exist in the space for a period right before the factory was demolished. The exhibition consisted of smaller sculptures of young children made from molasses which lined the floors, and a giant sphynx-like lady made of sugar that engulfed the room. It was a very immersive experience being in the place that produced the materials for the sculptures. The floors were sticky and the molasses babies were already melting apart, and the smell was cloying, so visitors interacted with the space in tangible ways. It was very meaningful as it referenced slavery and imperialism where sugar was traded for bodies. It was a poignant critique of our fascination with the monumentality of spectacle at a surface level possibly without understanding of backstory.

# Week 3 Journal : Hello World Reflection
------
It was exciting to have such an open-ended and exploratory intro to p5.js assignment. I found it quite liberating to experiment with the whole processing library at my fingertips. At first, I was confused about how the draw method worked, and why I was encountering image persistence when drawing a moving/animated shape. It was also confusing figuring out how to have multiple shapes on the same canvas moving at different intervals. Through documentation and google searching, I encountered a familiar concept of popping and pushing applied in a new, creative perspective that helped solve my "multi-shape" dilemma. As I began implementing moving shapes, I began to formulate an idea of a general theme/concept behind the piece. Throwing back to my highschool interests in astrophysics, I decided to make my sketch an abstract solar system. Following this, I started getting ideas for different distinctive planets, gathering inspiration for different pulsating movements and uses for "framecount" from various p5.js examples online. Along the way, I had further difficulties trying to draw a moving ellipse at a rotated offset. 

Moving forward, I should have probably asked for more direct assistance because I ended up spending too long trolling web forums for solutions. Sometimes I jump into creating pretty quickly, so it may have been beneficial to read through a more comprehensive intro/basics guide before starting. Later in the process, I decided to move some actions/shapes into separate functions in case I would need to call them in multiple circumstances. After further research, I was also able to add interactivity by clicking the sun to create a black hole and by pressing the keyboard to "save the world" and stop the sketch before it was consumed by darkness. Unfortunately I also didnt realize a console logger could be used to debug until later in the process, which did come in handy when implementing interactivity features. As it was such a dynamic process, along the way there were a few components that ended up getting commented out including the "cosmic background" randomly generated moving shapes across the screen. Though this added to the effect, I felt that it was slowing the animation down due to its processing intensity. 

Though I already had some basic familiarity with HTML/CSS and Git, and general coding principles, I have definitely already learned many new things: like Visual Studio code and its super useful interface, packages and testing environment (pretty lifechanging). I believe that class has been moving at a good pace that takes everyone's backgrounds into mind, and I bet it will be picking up soon as we dive into new topics. Overall I am quite happy with my piece, and I feel that even though the semester is young, I have already learned quite a lot about interactive graphics.
