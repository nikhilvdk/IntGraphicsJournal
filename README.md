### Rain Room

The first piece that stood out to me was Random International's Rain Room at MoMA. The rain room is a 1100 sqft exhibition with water falling from the ceiling. Visitors are able to walk though the rain without getting wet due to 3D tracking cameras which are used to sense a person’s presence. It was the first piece that came to my mind when I thought of users interfacing with art through technology. After braving the seemingly endless lines at the MoMA, where you can see the installation from the outside, the observer becomes the participant. Lighting is kept low to invoke dramatic shadows and a sense of obscurity. The sound the rain makes is an almost deafening white noise. This adds to the idea of being cocooned and protected – both physically from the rain, but also audibly and visually. I find it interesting that people are so excited to be immersed in rain, which we usually are so unhappy to encounter. Often times, visitors even try to reach out and touch it if the sensor misses them. Visitors have the freedom to walk through the space, creating the art and escaping to a reality where humans have control over the rain.

### A Subtlety

Another piece that I found really exciting and immersive was Kara Walker’s A Subtlety in Brooklyn’s famous Domino Sugar factory. I was able to go to this exhibit a few years ago and it was an exciting experience. The exhibit is inside an old and decrepit sugar factory that leaks from the ceilings and still has molasses dripping from the walls (I remember having to sign a waiver before entering). Domino allowed the art to exist in the space for a period right before the factory was demolished. The exhibition consisted of smaller sculptures of young children made from molasses which lined the floors, and a giant sphynx-like lady made of sugar that engulfed the room. It was a very immersive experience being in the place that produced the materials for the sculptures. The floors were sticky and the molasses babies were already melting apart, and the smell was cloying, so visitors interacted with the space in tangible ways. It was very meaningful as it referenced slavery and imperialism where sugar was traded for bodies. It was a poignant critique of our fascination with the monumentality of spectacle at a surface level possibly without understanding of backstory.
